## Installing Terraform


###### For macOS:

If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, you can use it to install Terraform. Just run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
brew install terraform
```

###### For Windows:

Proceed with the [official Terraform installation guide for Windows](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli#install-terraform).

###### For Linux:

Download the required version of Terraform from the [official downloads page](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html), unzip the downloaded file, and move the executable to one of the folders listed in the PATH (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`).

```bash
curl https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.15.0/terraform_0.15.0_linux_amd64.zip --output terraform.zip
unzip terraform.zip
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin
```

Please, replace the URL with the link to the appropriate Terraform version.
   
#### Ensure that Terraformâ€™s path is included in the PATH

You can check this by running:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

The output should include the location of your Terraform installation.

#### Once Installed

Run the `terraform version` command again to ensure that Terraform is installed and working properly.
